## Introduction

Understanding investor behavior is crucial for financial advisors, businesses, and policymakers aiming to tailor strategies that align with individual risk profiles. This study examines the influence of age on risk tolerance and investment preferences, with a particular focus on younger investors' inclination toward high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The primary research hypothesis posits that younger investors exhibit higher risk tolerance and are more likely to allocate a significant portion of their portfolios to high-risk assets. Additionally, the study explores the counterhypothesis that age does not significantly affect risk tolerance or asset allocation. 

The significance of this research lies in its potential to inform investment advisory practices and product development. Businesses in the financial services sector can better segment and target clients by understanding demographic variations in risk preferences. As cryptocurrencies and other high-risk assets gain prominence, insights into investor behavior can drive innovation in portfolio management tools and educational resources, enabling better alignment with client objectives and market trends. 

Moreover, the research addresses critical business challenges, including enhancing client satisfaction, reducing churn in investment advisory services, and optimizing product offerings. By analyzing variables such as financial literacy, diversification strategies, and investment objectives, the study provides actionable insights into the evolving landscape of investor behavior across age groups. 



## Methodology

This study employs a quantitative survey design to gather data on investors' demographic characteristics, financial literacy, risk tolerance, and portfolio composition. The survey instrument includes a structured questionnaire with a combination of multiple-choice, Likert-scale, and open-ended questions to capture a comprehensive dataset.

### Survey Design

The questionnaire was developed to address the following key areas:
1.	Demographics: Age, gender, education, income, marital status, and dependents.
2.	Financial Behavior: Financial literacy, risk tolerance, investment strategy, and portfolio composition.
3.	Risk Preferences: Comfort with high-risk investments, reactions to hypothetical scenarios, and primary investment objectives.
To ensure clarity and relevance, the questionnaire underwent pilot testing with a small sample of 10 participants, leading to refinements in phrasing and structure.

### Sampling Method

The research employed a non-probability convenience sampling technique, targeting individuals with diverse backgrounds through online distribution. The sample included respondents from various age groups (18–22, 23–28, 29–36, 37–44, and 45+), income levels, and employment statuses to capture a broad spectrum of investor profiles. Efforts were made to achieve gender balance and include respondents from both high- and low-risk investment backgrounds.

### Data Collection

Data was collected over two weeks via an online survey platform i.e. Google Forms, ensuring accessibility and ease of participation. Respondents were recruited through social media platforms, financial forums, and email invitations to relevant professional networks. Anonymity and confidentiality were maintained throughout the process to encourage honest responses.

### Analysis Plan

The collected data was cleaned and analyzed using statistical tools. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and behavioral variables, while inferential analyses, including correlation and regression, were conducted to test the hypothesis. Cross-tabulations were used to explore relationships between age, risk tolerance, and portfolio allocation. The analysis also included subgroup comparisons based on financial literacy levels and diversification strategies.
