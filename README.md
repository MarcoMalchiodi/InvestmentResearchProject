## Introduction

Understanding investor behavior is crucial for financial advisors, businesses, and policymakers aiming to tailor strategies that align with individual risk profiles. This study examines the influence of age on risk tolerance and investment preferences, with a particular focus on younger investors' inclination toward high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The primary research hypothesis posits that younger investors exhibit higher risk tolerance and are more likely to allocate a significant portion of their portfolios to high-risk assets. Additionally, the study explores the counterhypothesis that age does not significantly affect risk tolerance or asset allocation. 

The significance of this research lies in its potential to inform investment advisory practices and product development. Businesses in the financial services sector can better segment and target clients by understanding demographic variations in risk preferences. As cryptocurrencies and other high-risk assets gain prominence, insights into investor behavior can drive innovation in portfolio management tools and educational resources, enabling better alignment with client objectives and market trends. 

Moreover, the research addresses critical business challenges, including enhancing client satisfaction, reducing churn in investment advisory services, and optimizing product offerings. By analyzing variables such as financial literacy, diversification strategies, and investment objectives, the study provides actionable insights into the evolving landscape of investor behavior across age groups.
